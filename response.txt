I've created a complete implementation of the Pentos game! Let me explain the key components:

pieces.py:
Defines all 12 pentominoes using numpy arrays
Each piece has a unique color and shape
Includes rotation and manipulation methods
Implements piece collision detection
main.py:
Implements the core game mechanics
Features:
Piece movement (left/right/down)
Rotation with wall kick system
Hard drop and soft drop
Score tracking
Level progression
Next piece preview
Game over detection
Increasing difficulty (speed) with levels
Scoring system:
Single line: 100 points × level
Double line: 300 points × level
Triple line: 500 points × level
Quadruple line: 700 points × level
Pentos (5 lines): 800 points × level
Soft drop: 1 point per cell
Hard drop: 2 points per cell

~ after installing dependencies ~

Great! The game should now be running. Here's how to play:

Controls:

Left/Right Arrow: Move piece horizontally
Up Arrow: Rotate piece
Down Arrow: Soft drop (accelerate descent, 1 point per cell)
Space: Hard drop (instant placement, 2 points per cell)
Features:

12 unique pentominoes, each with a different vibrant color
Next piece preview
Score tracking
Level progression (speed increases with each level)
Line clearing with bonus points for multiple lines
Game over detection
Scoring System:

Single line: 100 points × level
Double line: 300 points × level
Triple line: 500 points × level
Quadruple line: 700 points × level
Pentos (5 lines): 800 points × level
Soft drop: 1 point per cell
Hard drop: 2 points per cell
The game will continue until pieces reach the top of the screen. Try to achieve the highest score possible by clearing multiple lines at once and using efficient piece placements!
